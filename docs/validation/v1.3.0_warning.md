# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: v1.3.0 IS BROKEN - DO NOT USE

**This release is completely unusable due to a critical parse-time error.**

## Issue

**Error:** Parse-time error due to missing Kraken2 incremental classifier module files

**Impact:**
- Pipeline fails immediately before execution starts
- Affects ALL execution modes, even with `--skip_kraken2`
- No workaround possible without code changes

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR ~ No such file or directory: Can't find a matching module file for include:
  /path/to/nanometanf/modules/local/kraken2_incremental_classifier/main
```

## Action Required

**UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY TO v1.3.1:**
```bash
nextflow run foi-bioinformatics/nanometanf -r v1.3.1 -profile conda
```

**v1.3.1 Release:** https://github.com/FOI-Bioinformatics/nanometanf/releases/tag/v1.3.1
- Fixes the critical bug
- Restores all functionality
- All Phase 2 and Phase 3 optimizations remain functional

**Alternative:** Revert to v1.2.0 (last stable release):
```bash
nextflow run foi-bioinformatics/nanometanf -r v1.2.0 -profile conda
```
